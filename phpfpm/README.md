# Magento PHP Service Container

A Reimagining of the PHP service from the [Docker Magento](https://github.com/kojiromike/docker-magento)
suite of containers.

The PHPFPM Service Container runs PHP FPM to process and serve Magento pages.

This version uses a version of PHP (currently 5.5.38) built from source using [phpbrew](https://phpbrew.github.io/phpbrew/).
